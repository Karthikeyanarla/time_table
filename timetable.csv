development studies for students. This course module is expected to serve four major purposes. First, it
will introduce and analyse the historical and philosophical emergence of development and capitalism
beginning in the 19th century until the Second World War. Secondly, it will introduce the writings of
major theorists in developmental thought. Thirdly it will engage with the areas of industrialisation,
urbanisation, environment, gender and political economy within the framework of development.
Fourthly it will introduce case studies from Latin America, Africa and Asia to give a critique of the
development discourse and explore methods of articulating a post-development discourse.",,,Counted towards HSS Elective and Minor

This discourse has remained largely unchanged in the post-colonial era. Much of this discourse is defined by a narrow and isolationist view of tribes. As a result, there is limited understanding of the dynamics of change in tribal societies. This course revisits this body of knowledge in the context of post-colonial India’s social dynamics, state policy, and socio-cultural developments. It delves into the sociological discourse of India’s indigenous peoples in terms of tribal movements, autonomy issues, protective discrimination, empowerment, and emerging development issues. It examines the politics of ethnicity, language, religion, and gender. The course will trace and analyse India’s multifaceted process of tribal society transformation over the last few decades. This course will be extremely beneficial to students working on tribal issues as well as those seeking a comprehensive introduction to tribal sociology through a nuanced analysis of contestations on various tribal issues. This course is intended as a Special Topics Course for PhD students, masters and advanced undergraduate students.",,,
